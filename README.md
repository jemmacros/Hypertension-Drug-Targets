# Hypertension-Drug-Targets
This repository contains supplementary material for the masters project "Identification and Prioritisation of Hypertension Drug Targets: A Multi-Tissue, Multi-Omics Approach" submitted to the University of Manchester for MSc Bioinformatics and Systems Biology.

Final_data.csv contains all gene prioritisation, enrichment, protein abundance, drug tractability, and protein class analysis results. In some instances two entries appear for one gene, this is due to the related protein being abundant in more than one tissue type.
